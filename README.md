# INTRO
Welcome to the ALX AirBnB Clone Software Engineer Project it's our _starting point_ for crafting an AirBnB-like application. 
This is where we'll dive into our first full-scale web app creation experience which is *super crucial* because it sets the stage for all the cool stuff ahead. 
We'll be learning about handling databases, working with APIs, merging front-end designs, and tinkering with HTML/CSS templates.
_Here's what the command interpreter can do_:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...

- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)

- Update attributes of an object

- Destroy an object

# USAGE
The console works both in interactive and non-interactive mode, just like a Unix shell.

# FILE DESCRIPTION
- console.py: The main entry point of the command interpreter
- all: Prints string representation of all instances
- update: Updates and instance based on class name and id
- EOF: exits console
- quit: exits console
- models/: main directory that contains the base model class
- engine/file\_storage: Main storage and reload script

# TESTING
- $python3 -m unittest discover tests: To run all tests at the same time
- $python3 -m unittest tests/test_base_model.py : To run one specific set of tests at a time
